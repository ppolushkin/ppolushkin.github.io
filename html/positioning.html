    <h1> Positioning
        <span class="label label-primary">CSS</span>
    </h1>

        <p>
            By default - <b>Static</b>
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Static</dt>
            <dd>
                - Static positioning simply means the content follows the normal top-down flow of HTML. Why would you
                want
                to assign an element static positioning? The short answer: You probably never will.
            </dd>

            <dt>Absolute</dt>
            <dd>
                - Absolute. Absolute positioning lets you determine an elementâ€™s location by specifying a left, right,
                top,
                or bottom position in pixels, ems, or percentages.
                Usefull for precize layers.An absolutely positioned element is actually placed relative to the
                boundaries of
                its closest positioned (~ relative positioned) ancestor
            </dd>

            <dt>Fixed</dt>
            <dd>
                - Fixed. A fixed element is locked into place on the screen. When a visitor scrolls the page, fixed
                elements
                remain onscreen as paragraphs and headlines, while photos disappear off the top of the browser window.
                Usefull for blockers, "always on top" parts, e.t.c.
            </dd>

            <dt>Relative</dt>
            <dd>
                - Relative. A relatively positioned element is placed relative to its current position in the HTML flow.
                So,
                for example, setting a top value of 20 pixels and left value of 200 pixels on a relatively positioned
                headline moves that headline 20 pixels down and 200 pixels from the left from wherever it would normally
                appear.
